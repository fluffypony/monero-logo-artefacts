# Monero Logo Artefacts

This is a collection of the original Monero and Monero Research Lab logo files. It includes the delivery from the 99designs logo contest, as well as the initial (very small) tweaks to kerning in the word "Monero", and the subsequent tweaks that were made.

All of these may be of historical interest, but also of the hi-res / vector source of everything.
